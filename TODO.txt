Flow control:
	Small rx buffer may be okay (signal when full)
	Will probably need TX done and RX interrupts on
	Modify uartRead and uartWrite so they honor RTS/CTS
	Set the PC-side programs to use flow control
	Use PuTTY in a VM for best results (forward FTDI USB port)

SD:
	Finish

RAM:
	Implement PCM quad read/write mode

SPI:
	Try to decrease the amount of work between begin/end sessions

Program size:
	Use decompressor stub + compressed code??
