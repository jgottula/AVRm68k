Priorities:
- Find approximate RAM timing limits
- Emulator
- SD
- Linux from scratch
- Bootloader
- HDD driver
- RTC chip for date/time

Optimizations:
- Set DRAM delays based on spec (if any such spec exists)
- Reduce the overhead between SPI begin/end sessions
- Use fast page mode to read WORD or LONG values
- Put nonatomic_block around _delay's in dramRead/Write

Program size:
- Use decompressor stub + compressed code?
