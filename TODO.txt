DRAM reading:
	Need to be able to pull OE high on the '595s to put them in high-Z
Flow control:
	Small rx buffer may be okay (signal when full)
	Will probably need TX done and RX interrupts on
	Modify uartRead and uartWrite so they honor RTS/CTS
	Set the PC-side programs to use flow control
	Use PuTTY in a VM for best results (forward FTDI USB port)
RAM:
	Find docs for 30-pin SIMM
	Buy the PCM found on DigiKey or another DRAM/SRAM
DRAM refresh:
	Create new timer interrupt (or use existing one)
SD:
	Re-import and finish
Program size:
	Use decompressor stub + compressed code??
Instructions:
	Implement memory: e.g. inc r/m8 should work on memory bytes
	Implement exceptions
