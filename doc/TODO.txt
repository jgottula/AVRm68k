Priorities:
- Find approximate RAM timing limits
- Emulator: memory system
- Emulator: addressing modes
- Emulator: instructions
  - Next: clr, cmp, eor, or, and
- Replace SIMM
  - Wire two address lines
  - Update IO defs
  - Replace all 20-bit addresses with 24-bit ones (0xffffff)
  - Tighten timings
- SD
- Linux from scratch
- Bootloader
- HDD driver
- RTC chip for date/time

Tests:
- m68k_mem: read and write, for all sizes
- ALL address modes

Optimizations:
- Set DRAM delays based on spec (if any such spec exists)
- Reduce the overhead between SPI begin/end sessions
- Use fast page mode to read WORD or LONG values
- Put nonatomic_block around _delay's in dramRead/Write
- Test AVR overclocks (6V is absolute max voltage; try ~5.5V overvolt somehow?)
- Remove debug code

Program size:
- Use decompressor stub + compressed code?

Overclocking:
- Use LM317/7806 to do up to 6V
- Problem: outputs need to be buffered or else all TTL-level components will be
  overvolted
