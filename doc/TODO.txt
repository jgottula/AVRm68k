Priorities:
- Find approximate RAM timing limits
- Emulator: memory system
- Emulator: addressing modes
- Emulator: instructions
- SD
- Linux from scratch
- Bootloader
- HDD driver
- RTC chip for date/time

Optimizations:
- Set DRAM delays based on spec (if any such spec exists)
- Reduce the overhead between SPI begin/end sessions
- Use fast page mode to read WORD or LONG values
- Put nonatomic_block around _delay's in dramRead/Write
- Test AVR overclocks (6V is absolute max voltage; try 5.x volts?)

Program size:
- Use decompressor stub + compressed code?
