Priorities:
- Replace SIMM
  - Rewrite read & write with correct timings and other things
  - Implement fast page mode functions for accessing words and longs
  - Implement read-modify-write (for incrementing memory locations, etc)
- Emulator: memory system
- Emulator: instructions
  - Next: movem, addi, add, cmp, rtr, rtd
- Emulator: emu instructions
  - dumpstack
- SD
  - Because of no card detect, throw fatal error upon early init problems
- Linux from scratch
- Bootloader
- HDD driver
- RTC chip for date/time

Tests:
- Address modes:
  - Addr reg indirect index
  - Addr reg indirect index base displacement
  - Memory indirect postindex
  - Memory indirect preindex
  - PC indirect index
  - PC indirect index base displacement
  - PC memory indirect postindex
  - PC memory indirect preindex
- Instructions:
  - pea (check stack)
  - jmp, jsr, bra, bsr (check stack)
  - all 16 conditional codes
  - tst (cond codes)
  - addq (all cond codes)
  - and/exg instr bits
  - or/sbcd instr bits
  - eor/or interaction

Optimizations:
- Remember to BENCHMARK/PROFILE all optimizations for determining efficacy
- Implement icache and/or dcache (internal ram and/or sram)
- Use fast page mode to read WORD or LONG values from dram
- Implement DMA using second microcontroller such as ATtiny13 (for cache
  writeback to DRAM, or SD writes, or for buffered asynchronous serial, etc)
- Reorder if/else statements so more likely instructions etc are first
- Remove debug code

Program size:
- Use decompressor stub + compressed code?

Overclocking:
- Get power as 12V (or 7.4V) and use another LM317 to get >5V
  - Or, use boost converter (more expensive/difficult)
  - This needs to be VERY precise
- Check that all TTL components (i.e. those not buffered with 4050) can
  withstand the overvolt
  - ATmega324A: abs max 6V, 5.5V reasonable
  - SMART DRAM: abs max 5.5V (pins can input abs max 7V though)
  - MAX232: abs max 6V, 5.5V reasonable
  - FT232R: abs max 6V, 5.25V reasonable
- Keep 3.3V devices at regular voltage
- Check that 3.3V outputs from SPI devices will actually register above the Vih
  threshold of the AVR (5.5-6V WILL be a problem)
  - Check if 4050 with Vcc 5V will actually pull 3.3V up to 5V
    - Alt: use bipolar discretes?
- Will need to buffer the UART tx line to 5V using 4050 (if using FTDI chip)
- It may be possible to use the ADC to track Vcc
