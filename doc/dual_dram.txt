Dual DRAM Support

- Adding another SIMM may not be so bad, and it provides some nice gains
- Non-shared pins (need for each SIMM):
  - /RAS
  - /CAS
- Shared pins (not duplicated between SIMMs):
  - /WE
  - Addr bus
  - Data bus (make sure this is hi-z when not in use by each SIMM)
- Advantages:
  - Greatly increased RAM capacity
  - Simultaneous refresh is possible!
  - Very few additional IO pins are needed
  - Additional time used for second DIMM might fill what would have been NOPs
- Disadvantages:
  - Probably means that a DRAM controller MCU is necessary
  - Won't make memory access any faster (already limited by AVR freq)
  - Needs more board space
    - When breadboarding, it won't be so bad: use two breadboards, and on one,
      place the SIMMs on each side and mostly bridge connections between them;
      the other breadboard can hold most of the other logic
    - Shouldn't be too bad on perfboard
- Having more than 16 MiB total RAM will require an extra address bit
  - This means modifying the DRAM access code, as well as making sure that all
    parts of the firmware won't explode if using 25 bits
