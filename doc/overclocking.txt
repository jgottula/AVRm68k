Overclocking Possibilities

For testing clock speeds at increased voltage, it may be useful to hook up a
	bare AVR running checked math so that each voltage and clock combo can be
	checked for feasibility

Overvolting
- Get power as 12V (or 7.4V) and use another LM317 to get >5V
  - Or, use boost converter (more expensive/difficult)
  - This needs to be VERY precise
- Check that all TTL components (i.e. those not buffered with 4050) can
  withstand the overvolt
  - ATmega324A: abs max 6V, 5.5V reasonable
  - SMART DRAM: abs max 5.5V (pins can input abs max 7V though)
  - MAX232: abs max 6V, 5.5V reasonable
  - FT232R: abs max 6V, 5.25V reasonable
  - 74HC595 (TI): abs max 7V, 6V reasonable
  - 4050 inputs: should be fine (good up to 20V)
- Keep 3.3V devices at regular voltage
- Check that 3.3V outputs from SPI devices will actually register above the Vih
  threshold of the AVR (5.5-6V WILL be a problem)
  - Check if 4050 with Vcc 5V will actually pull 3.3V up to 5V
    - Alt: use bipolar discretes?
- Will need to buffer the UART tx line to 5V using 4050 (if using FTDI chip)
- It may be possible to use the ADC to track Vcc
