Configurable BIOS

- Implement entirely in firmware
- Use serial UART text interface for POST and user configuration
- Save to AVR EEPROM, or perhaps the SPI EEPROM
- Expose user-configurable options
  - Set DRAM size
  - Enable/disable individual emulated devices
  - Enable/disable icache (if implemented)
  - View/set AVR fuses (non-useful or dangerous ones will be read-only)
  - Change DMA/DRAM controller settings (via special IO mode probably)
  - Enable/disable hardware debugger
