DRAM specs


Century SIMM from old 286 computer

- An extremely brief and unreadable datasheet exists
- Has 9 x Toshiba TC511000AJ-80 DRAM chips
- Capacity is 8 x 1Mib = 1 MiB
- Uses 4.5~5.5 volts
- Max current is 70 mA; standby current is 1-2 mA
- Logical zero voltage: < 0.8 volts
- Logical one voltage:  > 2.4 volts
- Support for fpm is questionable
- Probably doesn't support cbr refresh
- Timing requirements in nanoseconds (refer to other, better dataheets for the
  meanings of the subscript acronyms):
  - tRAC < 80
  - tRCY > 150
  - tCAD > 20
  - tAH  > 15
  - tP   > 60 
  - tWCY > 150
  - tDH  > 15
  - tRWC > 175
- Refreshing at 250 ms seems to retain data; 500 fails; <= 100 seems safest


OWC 16 MiB SIMM

- Has 8 x KM41C16000CK-6 (no parity)
- Datasheet with full specs is available
- This SIMM appears to have damage
  - It appeared early on, so it's likely not my fault
  - No way to return after soldering pins onto the pads


MemoryX 16 MiB SIMM

- Has 9 x KM41C6000AK-6 (has parity)
- Datasheet with full specs is available
- Works fantastically


Unknown 16 MiB SIMM

- Purchased from eBay
- SIMM pictured has 9 x HYB514100BJ-60
  - A good datasheet exists for this particular DRAM chip
  - Actual SIMM may have a different chip (it lacks parity, for example)
