- Breadboard:
  - 
- Perfboard:
  - Try to actually use decoupling capacitors
  - Use female pin headers as SIMM sockets
  - Use IC sockets for ALL chips so they will be replaceable
  - Plan for as many status LEDs as possible
  - Leave room and plan ahead for future additions
    - LCD
    - Battery
    - Other chips
    - Add-on boards
    - Second SIMM (see dual_dram.txt)
