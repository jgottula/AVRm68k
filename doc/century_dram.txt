Old DRAM specs

Century SIMM from old 286 computer
Has 9 x Toshiba TC511000AJ-80 DRAM chips
Capacity is 8 x 1Mib = 1 MiB

Uses 4.5~5.5 volts
Max current is 70 mA; standby current is 1-2 mA

Logical zero voltage: < 0.8 volts
Logical one voltage:  > 2.4 volts

Probably supports fast page mode


Timing requirements (in ns):
tRAC < 80  Row access time
tRCY > 150 ?
tCAD > 20  Column access time?
tAH  > 15  ?
tP   > 60  ?
tWCY > 150 ?
tDH  > 15  Mux to CAS delay??
tRWC > 175 ?

Refreshing at 250 ms seems to retain data; 500 fails; <= 100 seems safest
