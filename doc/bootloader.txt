Bootloader

- Firmware approach: do it directly from the AVR
  - Load kernel image, initrd; then jump in
  - Will need to implement basic FS support or store kernel raw somewhere
- Software approach: jump to the HDD MBR just like a real computer
  - Needs to expose the hard drive device to the bootloader
  - We can try syslinux, grub, grub2 (no no no), lilo?
