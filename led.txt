LEDs

Name	Color	How						Comments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
power	green	easy: attach to 5v		
reset	red		pnp on /reset			could be merged with power
error	red		io line					
rx		green	npn on rx				
tx		red		npn on tx				
rts/cts	red		npn on rts/cts			this is iffy; should mean io is behind
sck		red		npn on sck				
sd		red		pnp on sd_ss			alt: R & W leds, done with io lines
ram		green	pnp on cas				not ras since refresh will assert it

General comments:
- ALWAYS use a resistor for the base connection on PNP transistors!
- If more than three LEDs are running directly on IO lines, use a shift reg
	unless that takes too long
