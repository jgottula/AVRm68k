Possible Linux setups:
- Mainline linux, compiled for m68k: requires MMU emulation
- uCLinux: no MMU needed, but old codebase and non-standard
- Debian m68k port: unknown pros/cons/feasibility


BIOS/Bootloader:
- Will be written manually


Guide for cross-compiling Linux for m68k

The Linux/m68k website has tons of good information

0] Make sure that cross-m68k-gcc and cross-m68k-binutils are installed
1] Download the latest kernel tarball and extract it
2] Edit /Makefile:
	Find the ARCH line and set it to m68k
	In the next line, CROSS_COMPILE, put /usr/bin/cross/m68k-elf/
3] Use the default config: run `make multi_defconfig`
4] Compile the kernel: `make -j2 bzImage`
5] Compile modules: `make -j2 modules`
6] If a build failure occurs, modify the config to leave out the problematic
	module (set its line to 'n'), or google it. In one case, the solution was to
	add '-Dlinux' to NOSTDINC_FLAGS in the Makefile
7] You will now have the following files:
	Kernel:				/vmlinux
	Compressed kernel:	/vmlinux.bz2
	Symbol list:		/System.map
8] To install the modules into $TARGETDIR/lib/modules/x.y.z:
	`make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$TARGETDIR`
